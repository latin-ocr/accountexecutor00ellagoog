PREFACE·

After this the Archdcacon went into the two accounts moat
heartily and with much enjoyment: fortunately he had finished
the Introduction just before his death on November 27,1870‚so
that there was very little left for me to linioh of what hia family
handed over to me for that purpose3 Ι cannot therefore claim

much merit for my work aa joint Editor.

1 hope the Membera of our Society will accept it aa it ia, and
pardon the long delay in its publication, which, from various
circumstances beyond nry control, hasbeen unavoidable.

Ican truly say of Arehdeacon Hele :-

unornane fflbssnooeidit,
Nulli flebilior quam mihi.
