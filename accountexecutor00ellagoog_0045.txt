deacon of London, and apos· decretorum to the Archdeaoon of Col·
chester, which he had bought os W. de Montford’s executors.

But to discover how the account of Bishop Gravesend’s executore
stood was not so easy a taslr, deductions being everywhere made
from the reoeipts, and no totals either os the receipts or psyments
being stated. At p. 99 the words “Summa summarum omniurn
maneriorum,’' but there are no figures3 and also at p. 110 no figures
follow the “ Summa '⁹ with which the roll concludes. Bishop
Gravesend had calculated that he was possessed ol property to the
amount of two thousand marks; it turned out that he was possessed
ol' more than as many pounds; but his debts and legaoies and
funeral expenses absorbed it all, and the executors had buta little
in hand apparently to pay outstanding demands. To the estate of
the Bishop of Exeter the Desn and Chapter were the residuary
legatees, and to them was paid the large sum of 600l. It is com·
monly asserted that at the time when these hishops lived, the
beginning ol the fourteenth century, money was fifteen times aa
valuable as it now is. It would ill become me to call in question the
truth of this opinion, but it may serve to throw some light upon
the subjectis I state, not what was the value, hut the quantity, of
the money which came into the hands ol the executore, as found in
the treasury of the bishops. The sums stated are 1‚030t. and l48l.
Itis to be ohserved that the pound and the shilling were then only
moneys of account, and that the only coin was the silver penny,
and from what is stated in F ollre’s Tahle of English Silver Ceius we ⁸
leam that of the Tower pouud, of 5,400 grains (which was three·
quarters of an ounce lighter than the Troy pound), there were
coined 243 penoe, each penny weighing somewhat less then 22}
grains, and hence 240 pennies of full wcight‚ making twenty shillings
or a pound sterling in tale, contained as much silver as fifty-seven
shillings and five penoe of our present coin. According to the
tables in Clark’s Roman, Saxon, and English Coins, the shilling of
Edward the F irst was worth two shillings and tenpence farthing.
