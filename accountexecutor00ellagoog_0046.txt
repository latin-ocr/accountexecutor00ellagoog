We ahall therefore not greatly err if we multiply the above cuma by
three, end estimate the bullion in the two Thesauria of the biahopa
aa equal to 3‚0901. and 4441. of our present money. Aa respecta
the comparative value of eilver bullion, end of wheat, a simple
illuetmtion may bc given in the statement thet four chillinga being
the highest price allowed for a quarter of wheat by Biahop Graves·
end’a executore, tbe pound of bullion was equal to five quartem but,
when wheat ia in our time 660. per quanter, the pound of bullion ia
equal only to one.

The render will find in the Appendix abetracta of the executors’
wacena, where l have made acme annotatione upon them, following
the order in which the receipta and paymenta are given, aa moat
convenient for reference, and preventing any point worthy of notice

from being overlooketl
